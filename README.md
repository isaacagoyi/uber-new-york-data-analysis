# uber-new-york-data-analysis
This project explores Uber ride patterns in New York City using Python data-analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium. The analysis includes data cleaning, time-based feature engineering, visualization, and geospatial heatmaps to understand ride volume, peak activity periods, and spatial distribution.


The analysis uses several Uber datasets gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city:
Steps taken to Import Dataset to the Directory:
1) Create a folder called Datasets
2) Download the Uber Datasets using the above link and copy the Datasets listed below into the Datasets Folder
