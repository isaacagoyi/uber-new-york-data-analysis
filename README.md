# uber-new-york-data-analysis
This project explores Uber ride patterns in New York City using Python data-analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium. The analysis includes data cleaning, time-based feature engineering, visualization, and geospatial heatmaps to understand ride volume, peak activity periods, and spatial distribution.


The analysis uses several Uber datasets:

uber-raw-data-janjune-15_sample.csv – Sample dataset for Jan–June 2015

FOIL data (Jan–Feb) – Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv

Additional monthly Uber data files combined into a final dataset

The datasets contain:

Pickup timestamps

Latitude / Longitude

Base numbers

Vehicle activity numbers

Other relevant fields depending on source
